# NYC COVID-19 vaccine coverage by ZIP Code

I used data from the [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data) to map the percent of NYC residents (all ages) who received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine as of February 2023. Percents are displayed by Modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (MODZCTAs). MODZCTAs provide better estimates of population size than ZIP codes because they combine census blocks that have smaller populations.

3 levels of coverage were compared:
 1. Completed primary series
 2.  Received at least one dose
 3.  Received bivalent dose
